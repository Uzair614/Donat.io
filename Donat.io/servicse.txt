app design

create functions in php
	storing google sign in input
	send volunteer form data
	send donation request form data
	insertuserdata
criteria being sent back in json for requests
could put place ids as check for duplication in database


enum with donation types or maps with donation types
progress bar when loading from the internet
request forms in volunteer request for one to come collect donation
address fetching or manual entry in donation request form
google sign in
	make new admin
		connect with user id
			send toasts to confirm or deny admin making success
	send emergency notification
		need to send bundle to identify admin
	approve or disapprove donation requests
		need to send bundle to identify admin
	add new locations
			google map view
view for volunter to go on collection runs
sqlite for google maps
	google maps api

refactoring code smells
dummy values for google maps
collector showing on google maps?
directions to markers
color for views in donation selection
card view
